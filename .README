Yo bro

So here's the project. The point of the project is to get you familiar with Redux,
which is paramount to using React. It takes a bit of understanding the language
in order to understand the use of Redux.

Basic explanation: Lets say your user logs in and you have their username, email,
phone number, things they "like", etc. You get that info on the login page, how
does the User Profile screen get that information? You use Redux. So, when a user logs in,
you "dispatch" (synonyms would be 'send', but dispatch is the terminology) the user
to the "Redux Store", which will hold all the data you "dispatch" (send) to it.
Once you put something in the redux store, it will hold it as long as you want.

I imagine it like if you want to send a text, you send it from your phone, up to
a satellite, where it stays until the other person's phone is capable of receiving it

So you login and get a user from the database, then put it in Redux, then when
you go to the Profile Screen, you access the user from the redux store

Here's the project,

You will be a user and create different dishes or meals. It will be a form process,
so when you "Create", you'll go through a several page proces (you decide what it is),
but Im thinking its' like

Screen 1: add ingredients, there will be an IngredientForm in here, where you
list the ingredient and the amount, then you can add as many as you want

Screen 2: step by step instructions, will be a StepForm or call it whatever, where
you type what needs to be done with the ingredients and how long it is estimated to take

Screen 3: final regards on the dish, could put a picture in if you want, might be
good practice at accessing an iOS process (Camera Roll/Photos), also maybe some
other fields like total time to make, some bs rating system, whatever

When you "create", it will "add" it to your profile so that next time you login, it will display
the recipe on your homepage. Not the whole recipe right there, but a box with the name of
the dish and total cook time
Then, if you click it, it will display a detail page with dish name, ingredients list, cook steps, etc

But...lets start with the Create Form, thats the important part.

REDUX EXPLANATION
-------------------------------------------------------

So to use dispatch something to the redux store, you do so like
this.props.dispatch({});
The {} are the object that it takes as a parameter. It will always have a "type"
parameter, which basically specifies which reducer to hit

this.props.dispatch({ type: UserActions.SET_USER, username: 'Dude' })

Honestly, you might wanna call me for a better exlpanation, I'll still leave this here tho
